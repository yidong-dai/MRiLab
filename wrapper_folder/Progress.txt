Thank you for your interest to MRiLab.

The MRiLab project is open to the whole MRI community, any user who are 
interested to improve MRiLab is very welcome to do so. I will be very 
pleased if you can leave me feedback and ideas for better enhancing MRiLab 
functionality. I will also be very happy to talk about any kinds of 
collaboration for future MRiLab development. Please don't hesitate to 
contact me. Enjoy!
